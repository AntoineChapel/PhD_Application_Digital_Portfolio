# PhD Application Digital Portfolio
On this repository, you will find a variety of economics and coding projects I have designed independently. They reflect what I am able to do as a student, as a researcher and as a teacher.

It contains:
* masters_thesis: My master's thesis, the slides that were used for its defence, and the Jupyter Notebook that can be used for replication
* M+E+C_prerequisites_course: The course in economics and mathematics I wrote as a prerequisite to the math+econ+code PhD level masterclass. It is aimed at students in the first year of a master or students in the first semester of graduate school who wish to refresh their knowledge on optimization, numerical methods and discrete choice econometrics
* Presentations: Two presentations on matching theory and machine learning libraries that were presented to graduate students as part of the math+econ+code masterclas
