# PhD Application Digital Portfolio
On this repository, you will find the variety of economics and coding projects I have designed independently.

It contains:
* My master's thesis, slides that were used in my defence, and the Jupyter Notebook it is based on
* The course in economics and mathematics I wrote as a prerequisite to the math+econ+code PhD level masterclass. It is aimed at students in the first year of a master or students in the first semester of graduate school who wish to refresh their knowledge.
* Two presentations on matching theory and machine learning libraries that were presented as part of the math+econ+code masterclas
