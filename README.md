# PhD Application Digital Portfolio
On this repository, you will find the variety of economics and coding projects I have designed independently.

It contains:

\begin{itemize}
\item My master's thesis and the Jupyter Notebook it is based on
\item The course in economics and mathematics I wrote as a prerequisite to the math+econ+code masterclass
\item Other pedagogical contents on matching theory and machine learning libraries presented as part of the math+econ+code masterclass
\end{itemize}
